## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm) LTS version recommended.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running locally:

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    # Replace with the actual repository URL if available
    git clone https://gitlab.com/cibercom3/facturacion-cibercom.git
    cd facturacion-cibercom
    ```
    If you downloaded the files directly, navigate to the project's root directory.

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    Open your terminal in the project's root directory (where `package.json` is located) and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This command will download and install all the necessary packages defined in `package.json`.

3.  **Running the Development Server**
    This project is a client-side application and doesn't require a complex build step for development view. We use `serve`, a simple static file server.
    To start the development server, run:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This will typically start the server on `http://localhost:3000`. Open this URL in your web browser to view the application.
